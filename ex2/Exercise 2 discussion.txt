* Atomic operation: Operation is "hidden" from other threads, such that other threads cannot see intermediate operation data
* Semaphore: A flag saying to other processes/threads that this resource is busy, and that it cannot be accessed at this point.
* Mutex: Mutually Exclusive flag. It acts as a gate keeper to a section of code allowing one thread in and blocking access to all others.
* Critical section: Parts of the program where shared resources are accessed are protected. This protected section is called the critical section.
